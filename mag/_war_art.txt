A blank screen. A tirelessly blinking cursor that torments our eyes.
Whenever we are creating something, we are paralyzed by
an almost uncontrollable negative force.
What can we do?...
In his book "The War of Art", Steven Pressfield gives us some keys to overcome resistance, the negative force that feeds on our fears, which rise nonstop when we give in to it.
But fear hides a treasure: it hides everything that is important and valuable to us; be it the book you dream of writing or the business you want to start. Procrastination finds refuge in fear and uses our ego to keep the den safe.
The ego makes us vulnerable to events we don't control. The consequence is dire: we tend to procrastinate even more when goals are based on results that are beyond our control.

Carrying out any idea has to be independent of how many clients we achieve or how they value it. This always has to be the goal.
